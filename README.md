# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Link to the deployed app: TBD

The purpose of this app is to use the Moment.js library in the browser to work with date and time.

User Story<br>
As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar <br>
WHEN I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours<br>
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
WHEN I click into a timeblock, I can enter an event<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
WHEN I refresh the page, the saved events persist<br>
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:<br>
